# NR-docs-metadata
 model for metadata of documents in national repository

Reasons for some changes:
* subjectCategories - changed to optional - reason: old data from NUSL
*  dates - added dateIssued for original publication and dateAvailable stays for managing access to files in the repository. Solution is based on use-case of article preprints and postprints
* publisher - for docs is NOT a taxonomy but free text with the value whisperer, because of the variety in publishing, especially articles
